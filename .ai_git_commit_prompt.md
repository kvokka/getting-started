# Git commit message instructions

Use conventional commit message format.

- Avaliable types:
  - docs: 'Documentation only changes'
  - style: 'Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)'
  - refactor: 'A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature'
  - perf: 'A code change that improves performance'
  - test: 'Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests'
  - build: 'Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies'
  - ci: 'Changes to CI configuration files, scripts'
  - chore: 'Other changes that don't modify src or test files'
  - revert: 'Reverts a previous commit'
  - feat: 'A new feature'
  - fix: 'A bug fix'

- Scope: Extract from file paths or logical grouping (e.g., auth, api, ui)",
- Body (when needed):
  - Explain the motivation for the change
  - Compare previous behavior with new behavior
  - Note any breaking changes or important details
- Footer: Include references to issues, breaking changes if applicable

## Analysis Approach

1. Identify the primary purpose of the changes
2. Group related changes together
3. Determine the most appropriate type and scope
4. Write a clear, concise subject line
5. Add body details for complex changes

Remember: The commit message should help future developers understand WHY this change was made, not just WHAT was changed.
