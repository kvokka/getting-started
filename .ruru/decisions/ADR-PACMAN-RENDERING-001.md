# ADR-001: Pac-Man Game Rendering Technology Choice: PixiJS

**Status:** accepted

**Date:** 2025-05-09

## Context ü§î

*   **Problem:** The project requires selecting a suitable rendering technology for developing a 2D Pac-Man web game. Key features include Pac-Man's ability to shoot, dynamic ghost behavior, and integration within a Next.js and TypeScript-based application.
*   **Constraints:** The chosen technology must integrate well with Next.js and TypeScript, offer good performance for a 2D game of moderate complexity, have reasonable community support, and a manageable learning curve.
*   **Alternatives Considered Briefly:** Phaser.js (a full game engine) and using vanilla HTML5 Canvas with WebGL directly.

## Decision ‚úÖ / ‚ùå

*   **Chosen Decision:** PixiJS will be used as the primary 2D rendering engine for the Pac-Man game.

## Rationale / Justification üí°

*   **Performance and Control:** PixiJS is a fast and flexible 2D WebGL renderer, providing high performance for graphics-intensive operations while offering more control than a higher-level game engine if only rendering capabilities are primarily needed.
*   **Next.js and TypeScript Integration:** PixiJS integrates well with TypeScript. It can be incorporated into a Next.js/React application structure, allowing the game canvas and rendering logic to be managed as components within the broader application. This fits the specified tech stack.
*   **Balance of Features and Complexity:**
    *   Compared to vanilla WebGL, PixiJS significantly reduces development effort by providing a scene graph, sprite handling, text rendering, and other common 2D graphics abstractions.
    *   Compared to a full-fledged game engine like Phaser.js, PixiJS is more focused on rendering. This can be an advantage if the project prefers to build its own game loop, state management, and physics/collision systems, or use other specialized micro-libraries for those, leading to a potentially more modular architecture. For a Pac-Man game, the full suite of features in an engine like Phaser might not be entirely necessary.
*   **Community and Ecosystem:** PixiJS has an active community, good documentation, and a mature ecosystem, which is beneficial for development and troubleshooting.
*   **User Preference:** The project requirements hinted at a preference for WebGL, and PixiJS is a robust WebGL-based solution.

## Consequences / Implications ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Development Effort:** The development team will need to have or acquire proficiency in PixiJS. While simpler than raw WebGL, it still requires understanding its API and concepts.
*   **Game Logic Implementation:** Since PixiJS is primarily a rendering engine, core game logic components (e.g., game loop, state management, input handling, collision detection, entity management) will need to be implemented separately or by integrating other focused libraries. This allows for a custom-tailored game architecture.
*   **Modularity:** This choice promotes a separation of concerns, where rendering is handled by PixiJS, and other game systems can be developed as independent modules.
*   **New Work Required:**
    *   Integrate PixiJS into the Next.js project structure.
    *   Develop rendering components for game entities (Pac-Man, ghosts, pellets, maze, projectiles).
    *   Define interfaces between the rendering module and other game systems.
*   **Risks:**
    *   If the game's complexity grows significantly beyond initial scope to require advanced physics or complex scene management features readily available in full engines, there might be more re-implementation effort. Mitigation: Evaluate feature scope carefully; PixiJS can be extended.

## Alternatives Considered (Optional Detail) üìù

*   **Phaser.js:**
    *   **Description:** A popular, full-featured 2D game framework for HTML5 games, supporting Canvas and WebGL.
    *   **Pros:** Rapid development for common game patterns, built-in physics, input handling, asset loading, good TypeScript support, large community.
    *   **Cons:** Might be overkill if only a subset of its features are utilized for this specific Pac-Man game. Its more opinionated structure might be less flexible for deep integration into a Next.js app if a very custom component-based approach is desired.
*   **Vanilla HTML5 Canvas / WebGL:**
    *   **Description:** Using the browser's native Canvas 2D API or WebGL API directly without a library or engine.
    *   **Pros:** Maximum control over rendering, potentially the highest performance if optimized correctly, no external dependencies for rendering.
    *   **Cons:** Significantly higher development effort and complexity. Requires implementing all rendering abstractions (scene graph, sprite batching, transformations, shaders for WebGL, etc.) from scratch. Steeper learning curve, especially for WebGL.
