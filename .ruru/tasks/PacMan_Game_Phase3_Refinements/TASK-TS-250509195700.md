# Pac-Man: Final Refinement - Remove /pacman Route and Re-verify Build

## 🎯 Goal

Ensure the `/pacman` route is completely removed by deleting the `pacman-game/src/app/pacman/` directory, and then re-verify that the project builds successfully and the build output reflects this change.

## 📝 Description

The previous refinement task ([`TASK-TS-250509194500.md`](./TASK-TS-250509194500.md:1)) aimed to move the game to the root path and delete the `/pacman` route. However, the `pacman-game/src/app/pacman/` directory was not deleted, causing the build to still include this route. This task is to explicitly delete that directory and confirm the build output.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

*   - [ ] The directory `pacman-game/src/app/pacman/` and all its contents are successfully deleted.
*   - [ ] The command `npm run build` executed in the `pacman-game` directory completes successfully without errors.
*   - [ ] The output of `npm run build` no longer lists the `/pacman` route.
*   - [ ] The Pac-Man game remains accessible and functional at the root path (`http://localhost:3000/`).

## 📋 Checklist

*   - [✅] Delete the directory `pacman-game/src/app/pacman/` using a file system operation.
*   - [✅] Execute `npm run build` in the `pacman-game` directory.
*   - [✅] Confirm the build completes without errors.
*   - [✅] Inspect the build output to ensure the `/pacman` route is no longer listed.
*   - [ ] Perform a quick test run of the game at the root path (`/`) to ensure functionality.
*   - [ ] Commit changes to version control (if applicable by specialist workflow).
