# Pac-Man: Phase 2 - Project Setup & Next.js Shell with PixiJS Canvas Integration

## üéØ Goal

Initialize the Next.js project structure (if not already fully set up for this specific game), integrate PixiJS, and render a basic PixiJS stage/canvas within a Next.js component. This serves as the foundational rendering layer for the Pac-Man game.

## üìù Description

This task involves setting up the Next.js environment with TypeScript, installing PixiJS, and creating a React component that successfully initializes and displays a PixiJS canvas. A simple visual confirmation (e.g., a colored rectangle) should be rendered to verify the integration.

This is the first step in the implementation phase, building upon the architecture defined in [`TASK-ARCH-250509153800.md`](../PacMan_Game_Phase1_Arch/TASK-ARCH-250509153800.md:1) and [`ADR-PACMAN-RENDERING-001.md`](../../decisions/ADR-PACMAN-RENDERING-001.md:1).

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

*   - [ ] A Next.js project is configured and running with TypeScript.
*   - [ ] PixiJS (`pixi.js`) and its type definitions (`@pixi/typescript` or types bundled with `pixi.js` v7+) are installed as project dependencies.
*   - [ ] A React component (e.g., `GameCanvas.tsx`) is created to encapsulate the PixiJS application.
*   - [ ] The `GameCanvas.tsx` component successfully initializes a PixiJS `Application` instance.
*   - [ ] The PixiJS canvas is correctly mounted to a DOM element within the Next.js page structure.
*   - [ ] A simple PixiJS graphic (e.g., a `PIXI.Graphics` rectangle or `PIXI.Text` object) is added to the PixiJS stage.
*   - [ ] This graphic is visible and correctly rendered when the relevant Next.js page is loaded in a browser.
*   - [ ] The setup includes basic error handling for PixiJS initialization (e.g., console logs for WebGL context issues).
*   - [ ] Code is well-structured and follows TypeScript best practices.

## üìã Checklist

*   - [‚úÖ] Confirm or initialize Next.js project structure (e.g., using `create-next-app`) with TypeScript.
*   - [‚úÖ] Install `pixi.js` dependency.
*   - [‚úÖ] Install/confirm TypeScript type definitions for PixiJS (e.g., `@types/pixi.js` if needed, or rely on bundled types).
*   - [‚úÖ] Create `src/components/GameCanvas.tsx` (or similar).
*   - [‚úÖ] Implement the `GameCanvas` component to initialize `PIXI.Application`.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Handle component mounting/unmounting to create/destroy PixiJS app.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Ensure the canvas is appended to a ref element.
*   - [‚úÖ] Add a test graphic (e.g., a red square at `(50,50)`) to the PixiJS stage within `GameCanvas.tsx`.
*   - [‚úÖ] Integrate `GameCanvas.tsx` into a Next.js page (e.g., `src/app/pacman/page.tsx`).
*   - [ ] Verify the test graphic renders correctly in the browser.
*   - [‚úÖ] Add basic logging for PixiJS initialization success/failure.
*   - [ ] Commit initial setup to version control (if applicable by specialist workflow).

## üñºÔ∏è Design / UI (If Applicable)

N/A for this setup task, but the canvas should be visible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

*   Ensure server-side rendering (SSR) compatibility if attempting to render the component holding the canvas on the server, or ensure it's client-side only using `next/dynamic`. PixiJS typically requires a browser environment.
*   Consider responsive canvas sizing or fixed dimensions as per initial requirements.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Risks & Challenges

*   Compatibility issues between Next.js version and PixiJS.
*   Ensuring WebGL context is available and correctly initialized.
*   Handling client-side only rendering for the PixiJS canvas within Next.js.
