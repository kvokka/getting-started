# Pac-Man: Code Cleanup - Remove Unused Comments & Excessive Console Logs

## üéØ Goal

Review the existing TypeScript codebase for the Pac-Man game (`pacman-game/src/`) and remove any unnecessary commented-out code and excessive/debug `console.log` statements to improve code clarity and maintainability.

## üìù Description

Following the initial implementation phase, this task focuses on cleaning up the codebase. This includes:
*   Identifying and removing blocks of code that were commented out during development and are no longer needed.
*   Removing or commenting out `console.log()` statements that were used for debugging purposes and are not essential for production or standard development logging. Legitimate logging (e.g., errors, critical lifecycle events) should be preserved or refined.

The primary focus is on files within the `pacman-game/src/` directory, including components, library files (GameManager, entities, maze), and pages.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

*   - [ ] All `.ts` and `.tsx` files within `pacman-game/src/` have been reviewed.
*   - [ ] All clearly obsolete or redundant commented-out code blocks have been removed.
*   - [ ] All purely diagnostic/temporary `console.log()` statements have been removed.
*   - [ ] Essential logging (if any) remains or is clearly marked (e.g., `// INFO:`, `// WARN:`, `// ERROR:` if not using a formal logger).
*   - [ ] The game functionality remains unchanged after the cleanup.
*   - [ ] Code remains well-structured and follows TypeScript best practices.

## üìã Checklist

*   - [‚úÖ] Review `pacman-game/src/components/GameCanvas.tsx`.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Remove unused comments.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Remove excessive `console.log`s.
*   - [‚úÖ] Review `pacman-game/src/lib/GameManager.ts`.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Remove unused comments.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Remove excessive `console.log`s (retain essential ones like game loop delta if deemed necessary for dev, or errors).
*   - [‚úÖ] Review `pacman-game/src/lib/entities/PacMan.ts`.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Remove unused comments.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Remove excessive `console.log`s.
*   - [‚úÖ] Review `pacman-game/src/lib/maze/MazeManager.ts`.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Remove unused comments.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Remove excessive `console.log`s.
*   - [‚úÖ] Review `pacman-game/src/app/pacman/page.tsx`.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Remove unused comments.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Remove excessive `console.log`s.
*   - [‚úÖ] Review any other `.ts` or `.tsx` files created within `pacman-game/src/`.
*   - [‚úÖ] Perform a quick test run of the game (`npm run dev` in `pacman-game` and check `http://localhost:3000/pacman`) to ensure no functionality was broken during cleanup.
*   - [~] Commit changes to version control (if applicable by specialist workflow).

## üñºÔ∏è Design / UI (If Applicable)

N/A. This is a code-only cleanup task.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

*   Be cautious not to remove comments that provide valuable context or explanation for complex logic.
*   Distinguish between temporary debug logs and intentional, informative logging.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Risks & Challenges

*   Accidentally removing necessary comments or logs.
*   Introducing regressions if code is removed incorrectly (though less likely with comment/log removal).

## ü™µ Log Entries

- `[2025-05-09T19:38:06Z]` **util-typescript**: All files in `pacman-game/src/` reviewed. Unnecessary comments and console logs removed from `GameCanvas.tsx`, `GameManager.ts`, `PacMan.ts`, and `app/pacman/page.tsx`. No changes needed for `MazeManager.ts`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`. Game test run performed. Marked commit step as N/A. Task complete.
