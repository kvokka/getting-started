summary: |
  Completed initial implementation for Pac-Man entity and movement for MDTM task TASK-TS-250509182000.
  - Created `pacman-game/src/lib/entities/PacMan.ts` with PacMan class, properties (x, y, speed, direction, sprite), constructor, and update method.
  - Modified `pacman-game/src/lib/GameManager.ts`:
    - Added `Direction` enum.
    - Imported `PacMan` class.
    - Added `pacman` property and `intendedDirection`.
    - Stored loaded 'pacman' texture.
    - Instantiated `PacMan` entity and added its sprite to the stage.
    - Implemented `setupInputHandlers` for arrow key presses.
    - Updated `GameManager.update` to control PacMan's direction and call `pacman.update()`.
    - Implemented basic boundary collision.
  - Resolved a TypeScript error in `GameManager.destroy()` related to `baseTexture` option.
  - Updated checklist in `TASK-TS-250509182000.md`.
details: |
  Files modified:
  - `pacman-game/src/lib/entities/PacMan.ts` (created)
  - `pacman-game/src/lib/GameManager.ts` (modified)
  - `.ruru/tasks/PacMan_Game_Phase2_Impl/TASK-TS-250509182000.md` (checklist updated)

timestamp: 2025-05-09T18:31:13Z
mode: util-typescript
task_id: TASK-TS-250509182000
action: Debugging - Asset Creation
summary: |
  Addressed issue where the Pac-Man game page was showing the default Next.js stub.
  - Diagnosed the root cause as a missing asset: `pacman-game/public/assets/pacman_placeholder.png`.
  - The `list_files` tool confirmed the asset was not present.
  - After multiple `write_to_file` attempts failed due to tool errors, successfully created the asset by copying `public/next.svg` to `public/assets/pacman_placeholder.png` using `execute_command` with corrected relative paths.
details: |
  Command executed: `mkdir -p public/assets && cp public/next.svg public/assets/pacman_placeholder.png` (cwd: `/workspace/pacman-game`)
  This should allow `GameManager` to load the necessary asset and initialize the game correctly.
  The user should refresh the browser page for the `/pacman` route.

task_id: TASK-TS-250509182000
action: Finalizing Task - Pac-Man Entity
summary: |
  Completed MDTM task TASK-TS-250509182000.
  - Successfully debugged asset loading issues. Initially, a placeholder PNG was missing, then an SVG renamed to PNG caused decoding errors.
  - Instructed user to use `docs/test_requests/assets/pacman-icon.svg`, copied it to `pacman-game/public/assets/pacman_icon.svg`, and updated `GameManager.ts` to use it.
  - Implemented sprite scaling in `GameManager.ts` for the new SVG asset.
  - Implemented sprite rotation in `PacMan.ts` entity to face the direction of movement.
  - Addressed a Next.js hydration error by converting `pacman-game/src/app/pacman/page.tsx` to a client component and adjusting how `GameCanvas` is rendered.
  - Made the `GameManager.destroy()` method more robust.
  - User confirmed Pac-Man icon is reasonably sized, controllable, and rotates correctly. No console errors reported by the user.
  - Updated checklist and status in `TASK-TS-250509182000.md` to "游릭 Done".
details: |
  Final changes involved:
  - Copying `docs/test_requests/assets/pacman-icon.svg` to `pacman-game/public/assets/pacman_icon.svg`.
  - Updating `GameManager.ts` to load `/assets/pacman_icon.svg`.
  - Adding scaling logic for the sprite in `GameManager.ts`.
  - Adding rotation logic to `PacMan.setDirection()` in `PacMan.ts`.
  - Updating `pacman-game/src/app/pacman/page.tsx` to use `useState` and `useEffect` for client-side rendering of `GameCanvas`.
  - Updating MDTM task file status to "游릭 Done".
