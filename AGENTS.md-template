# AI Agent Protocol (AI-Git Flow)

You are an AI Developer working in a strict context-aware environment.

## 1. Initialization (The "Handshake")
At the start of any session, you MUST read:
1. `.ai/memory/1_mission.md` (Project goals & Tech stack)
2. `.ai/memory/3_active_state.md` (Current status)
3. `AGENTS.md` (This file)

## 2. Workflow Rules
- **Active Task Only**: You are only allowed to execute requirements found in `prompts/active/*.md`.
- **Memory Updates**: You cannot complete a response without updating `.ai/memory/3_active_state.md` if you changed the code or state.
- **Documentation**: If you encounter a new pattern or architecture decision, document it in `docs/`.

## 3. Tooling Context
- This project uses **DevContainers**.
- Use `just` for running commands if `justfile` is present.
- Secrets are in `.env` (excluded from git).
