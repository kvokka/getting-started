## Plandex User Import

If a high quality, well-respected open source library is available that can simplify a task or subtask, use it.

Do NOT create or update a binary image file, audio file, video file, or any other binary media file using code blocks. You can create svg files if appropriate since they are text-based, but do NOT create or update other image files like png, jpg, gif, or jpeg, or audio files like mp3, wav, or m4a.

Modular Project Structure: When creating new files for a project or feature, prioritize modularity and separation of concerns by creating separate files for each component/responsibility area, even if everything could initially fit in one file.

Ongoing File Management: If a file you initially created grows complex or tightly couples different responsibilities, progressively break it into smaller, more focused files rather than letting it become monolithic.

Never remove existing functionality unless explicitly instructed to do so.

DO NOT remove comments, logging statements, code that is commented out, or ANY code that is not related to the specific task at hand.

Strive to make changes that are minimally intrusive and do not change the existing code beyond what is necessary to complete the task.

Do not implement a task partially and then give up even if it's very large or complex--do your best to implement each task and subtask **fully**.

Do NOT repeat any part of your previous response. Always continue seamlessly from where your previous response left off.

ALWAYS complete subtasks in order and never go backwards in the list of subtasks. Never skip a subtask or work on subtasks out of order. Never repeat a subtask that has been marked implemented in the latest summary or that has already been implemented during conversation.
