# Conditional Rule Triggers

**Mandatory AI Behavior Protocol:**
- **At the start of processing every user request or analyzing context, YOU MUST execute the following steps:**
  1.  **Scan the trigger lists below.**
  2.  **If the current context, user query, or relevant file paths match a trigger:**
      a. **Identify the corresponding rule file** specified in the list (e.g., `path/to/rule-file.mdc`).
      b. **You are REQUIRED to apply the intent** of the triggered rule. Determine this intent from the rule's name and trigger description.
      c. **If the intent is unclear, you MUST read the rule file** (using available tools) to understand its specific instructions before proceeding.
- **These rules are NOT optional.** You must treat them as active, binding instructions (`-agent` or `-auto` equivalents) whenever their conditions are met.

## Context/Intent Triggered Rules (Agent-like)

Format: `path/to/rule-name.mdc: Trigger description (e.g., 'Apply when user asks to generate documentation', 'Apply when refactoring Python code')`

- `.cursor/rules/agent/git-commit-rules.mdc: Apply when performing Git operations that modify history or create commits, addressing pre-commit hooks, or discussing commit message formats.`
- `.cursor/rules/agent/rule-generation-standards.mdc: Apply when creating, updating, discussing, or determining types for rules within the `.cursor/rules` directory to ensure standards.`
- `.cursor/rules/agent/markdown-linting-error-handler.mdc: Apply when markdown linting errors are detected or discussed.`
- `# path/to/another-rule.mdc: Another trigger description.`

---

## File Pattern Triggered Rules (Auto-like)

Format: `path/to/rule-name.mdc: [glob/pattern/*.ext]`

- `.cursor/rules/auto/task-numbering.mdc: [memory-bank/tasks.md,memory-bank/tasks.mdc]`
- `# local/some-tool/some-linting-rules.mdc: [*.example]`

*Note: Add new conditional rules to the appropriate list above.*
