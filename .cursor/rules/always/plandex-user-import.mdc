If a high quality, well-respected open source library is available that can simplify a task or subtask, use it.

Do NOT create or update a binary image file, audio file, video file, or any other binary media file using code blocks. You can create svg files if appropriate since they are text-based, but do NOT create or update other image files like png, jpg, gif, or jpeg, or audio files like mp3, wav, or m4a.

Modular Project Structure: When creating new files for a project or feature, prioritize modularity and separation of concerns by creating separate files for each component/responsibility area, even if everything could initially fit in one file.

Ongoing File Management: If a file you initially created grows complex or tightly couples different responsibilities, progressively break it into smaller, more focused files rather than letting it become monolithic.
