# Conditional Sequential Thinking

If an incoming user prompt or system message contains `<thinking>` tags:

1. Attempt to use the `MCP sequentialthinking` tool to process the structured thought outlined within those tags.
2. If the `MCP sequentialthinking` tool is unavailable or fails, fall back to your standard internal thinking process to interpret and respond to the request, using the content within the `<thinking>` tags as guidance.

If the input does *not* contain `<thinking>` tags, proceed with your standard internal thinking process.
