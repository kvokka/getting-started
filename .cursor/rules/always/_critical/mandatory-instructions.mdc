# _Critical

## Mandatory Instructions

- You absolutely must apply known best practices before new file creation or changes proposal.

- Instead of using the standard `git commit` terminal command, use the following format with an appropriate commit message:

   ```bash
     ag -g 1 -y -p 'commit message'
   ```

   1. In case of ANY error, look for the solution until you find how to fix the code you generated.
   Use MCP tools provided to fetch the documentation, you have 5 attempts.
   2. Check that all the changes are successfully committed in git repo

- SEQUENTIAL_CHECKPOINT: Before proceeding to any new step in an instruction sequence, I must explicitly
  verify and confirm completion of ALL preceding steps, especially those marked as critical or mandatory.
  No exceptions.

### Implementation

- Ensure code follows established patterns in the project
- Verify all needed imports are included
- Check that the proposed changes meet the project's coding standards
- Follow security best practices
- Consider performance implications of changes
