# _Critical

## Mandatory Instructions

- You absolutely must apply known best practices before new file creation or changes proposal.

- Instead of using the standard `git commit` terminal command, use the following format with an appropriate commit message:

   ```bash
     ag -g 1 -y -p 'commit message'
   ```

   1. In case of ANY error, look for the solution until you find how to fix the code you generated.
   Use MCP tools provided to fetch the documentation, you have 5 attempts.
   2. Check that all the changes are successfully committed in git repo

- prepend shell commands with `timeout X `, where X is reasonable amount in seconds for the command to run
  in range from 15 to 300. In case of error as the first step check if it was expected to get any imput from user

### Implementation

- Ensure code follows established patterns in the project
- Verify all needed imports are included
- Check that the proposed changes meet the project's coding standards
- Follow security best practices
- Consider performance implications of changes
