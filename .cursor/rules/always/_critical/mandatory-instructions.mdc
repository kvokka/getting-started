## Mandatory Instructions

- You absolutely must apply known best practices before new file creation or changes proposal.

### Checkpoint

- To make checkpoint to store the changes using this command with a clear message:

   ```bash
   ag -a -g 1 -y -p 'message describing checkpoint'
   ```

- Validation checks ensure code quality. If errors occur, read terminal output,
fix issues, and retry with the same command. Some errors are auto-corrected,
with details in terminal logs.

- Use MCP tools to find solutions for errors.

- You have 5 attempts to resolve issues. Then ask user for help.

- Confirm the command succeeded (zero exit status and success message in logs). If it failed, report the error and retry after fixing.

### Terminal

- prepend shell commands with `timeout X`, where X is reasonable amount in seconds for the command to run
  in range from 15 to 300. In case of error as the first step check if it was expected to get any imput from user

### Implementation

- Ensure code follows established patterns in the project
- Verify all needed imports are included
- Check that the proposed changes meet the project's coding standards
- Follow security best practices
- Consider performance implications of changes
