### Checkpoint

- To create checkpoint which store the changes using this command with a clear message:

   ```bash
   ag -a -g 1 -y -p 'checkpoint message'
   ```

- Validation checks ensure code quality. If errors occur, read terminal output,
fix issues, and retry checkpoint creation. Some errors are auto-corrected,
with details in terminal logs.

- Use MCP tools to find solutions to fix the errors.

- Confirm the command succeeded (zero exit status and success message in logs). If it failed, report the error and retry after fixing.

  in range from 15 to 300. In case of error as the first step check if it was expected to get any input from user
