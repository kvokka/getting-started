# VsCode boilerplate

The original boilerplate was from from this MS [repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-go)

Based on my [dotfiles](https://github.com/kvokka/dotfiles/) repo VsCode project
basic setup using devContainers, docker-compose and MCP.

Assumed to be language agnostic, golang taken just for the basic example.
